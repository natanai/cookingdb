1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch square baking dish (stone preferred; glass or metal ok) with {{neutral_oil}}, then wipe off any excess.
2. Make sure {{coconut_milk}} is fully smooth before measuring: whisk or blend room-temperature full-fat coconut milk until completely mixed and smooth, then measure out {{coconut_milk}}.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together {{oat_flour}}, {{almond_flour}}, {{tapioca_starch}}, {{cornstarch}}, {{sugar}}, {{baking_powder}}, and {{salt}} until no lumps remain.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together {{coconut_milk}}, {{lemon_juice}}, zest of {{lemon_for_zest}}, and {{vanilla_extract}}.
5. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
6. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out completely clean. Cool completely (about 45 minutes) before glazing.
7. For a full glaze, whisk together {{powdered_sugar}}, {{lemon_juice_glaze}}, {{glaze_thickener}}, and {{vanilla_glaze}} until completely smooth. For a light drizzle, make half this glaze by halving those four ingredients.
8. Spread the glaze over the cooled cake. Let it set for about 15 minutes, then slice and serve.
