1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Cream {{fat}}, then gradually beat in {{sugar}} until smooth.
3. Add {{egg_component}} unbeaten (do not pre-whisk separately) and beat well.
4. Mix in {{almond_extract}} and {{food_coloring}} (if using).
5. Whisk together {{flour_base}}, {{baking_powder}}, and {{salt}}. Stir into the dough, then add up to {{flour_adjust}} only if needed so the dough is not too dry; skip the extra flour entirely if using the yolks option.
6. If using butter, cover and refrigerate the dough for about 1 hour to firm it before pressing.
7. Fit a cookie press disk (number side up)—a cookie press is required—pack the press firmly, and press cookies onto an ungreased shiny cookie sheet.
8. Bake for 10–12 minutes.
