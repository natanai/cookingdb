1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Drain {{pear_halves}}, reserving the syrup.
2. Peel and thickly slice {{sweet_potatoes}}. Arrange them in the bottom of a shallow baking dish.
3. Trim excess fat from {{pork_chops}}, season with {{salt}} and {{black_pepper}}, and brown lightly in a skillet. Place the chops on top of the sweet potatoes.
4. In a small saucepan, combine the reserved pear syrup with {{brown_sugar}}, {{butter}}, and {{cinnamon}}. Heat just until the sugar dissolves.
5. Spoon half of the syrup over the chops. Bake for 30 minutes.
6. Remove the dish from the oven, arrange {{pear_halves}} around the chops, and spoon the remaining syrup over everything. Bake for another 30 minutes, or until the chops are tender.
