1. Slice {{chicken_breast}} in half lengthwise to form thinner cutlets. Cover and pound to an even thickness, then pat dry.
2. Season both sides of {{chicken_breast}} with {{salt}}, {{black_pepper}}, and {{italian_seasoning}}. Dredge in {{flour_dredge}} mixed with {{parmesan_dredge}}, tapping off excess.
3. Heat {{olive_oil}} in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear {{chicken_breast}} for 4–5 minutes per side until golden. Remove and set aside.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low and melt {{butter}} in the same skillet. Add {{garlic_cloves}} and cook until softened and caramelized, about 6–7 minutes.
5. Sprinkle in {{flour_sauce}} and cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring until the raw flour smell is gone.
6. Gradually whisk in {{chicken_broth}} mixed with {{bouillon}}, {{soy_sauce}}, {{onion_powder}}, {{thyme}}, and {{mustard_powder}} until smooth.
7. Stir in {{heavy_cream}} and bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low.
8. Gradually stir in {{parmesan_finish}} until melted.
9. Return {{chicken_breast}} and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Spoon sauce over the top, cover partially, and simmer for 5 minutes.
