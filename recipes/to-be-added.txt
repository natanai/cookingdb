Veggie Teriyaki Stir-Fry with Noodles

Ingredients

4 ounces soba noodles, brown rice noodles, spaghetti or long noodle of choice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil
1 medium red or white onion, halved and thinly sliced
½ teaspoon fine sea salt
6 cups thinly sliced mixed vegetables*
½ cup teriyaki sauce, or more as needed
1 to 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, to taste
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
¼ cup thinly sliced green onion, for garnish
Instructions
Bring a pot of water to boil and cook the noodles until al dente, according to package directions. Drain and rinse well to remove any excess starch. Set aside.

Meanwhile, warm a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, onion and salt. Cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender, about 4 to 6 minutes.
Add the remaining vegetables and cook until they are tender and caramelizing on the edges, stirring every minute or two. Given the volume of vegetables, this will take about 10 to 15 minutes.
Once the vegetables are done, add the noodles and ½ cup teriyaki sauce to the pan. Stir to combine, and cook just until the ingredients are all warmed through, about 1 minute. Feel free to add more teriyaki sauce if you like your noodles extra-saucy.
Remove the skillet from the heat. Add toasted sesame oil, to taste (a little goes a long way/toss with tongs if you need help mixing the noodles into the veggies). Add the sesame seeds.
Serve the noodles in bowls with sliced green onion and a little sprinkle of sesame seeds on top. Leftovers keep well, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 days.
Notes

*Vegetable suggestions: Aim to slice your veggies into ¼-inch wide strips for even cooking. Use any combination of portobello or baby bella mushrooms, bell pepper, snap peas (halved vertically), cabbage, carrot (cut thin on the diagonal), or kale.

Make it vegan: Make or buy vegan teriyaki sauce. My teriyaki sauce recipe has a vegan option (simply use maple syrup instead of honey).

Make it gluten free: Be sure to use gluten-free teriyaki sauce (most aren’t gluten free, but my recipe has a gluten-free option). Also choose gluten-free noodles, such as brown rice noodles (available at Whole Foods) or spaghetti noodles (I’d probably use a corn and quinoa blend because they tend to retain their shape better than others).

Brown Rice

ingredients

1 cup brown rice (short, medium or long grain brown rice will work, as long as it’s not a quick-cooking variety)
6 cups water
Salt, soy sauce or other desired seasonings, to taste
Instructions
Bring a large pot of water to boil, using at least 6 cups water per 1 cup rice. Rinse* the rice in a fine mesh colander under running water to remove excess starch.
Add the rice to the boiling water. Reduce the temperature as necessary to prevent overflow, but maintain a steady boil. Boil, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
Drain off the remaining cooking water and return the rice to the pot. Cover the pot and let the rice rest, off the heat, for 10 minutes. Fluff, season as desired, and serve.


*Note on rinsing: I’ve forgotten to rinse my rice before, and the rice turned out almost as good. The cooked grains are a little more starchy—you can see a thin layer of gluey starch at the bottom of the pot after steaming. If you’re in a hurry, skip the rinse.

Make it gluten free: Rice is gluten free, so just be mindful of your additions. Soy sauce, for example, is not gluten free (substitute certified gluten-free tamari instead).

Wild rice option: For wild rice, use 8 cups water and boil for 40 to 55 minutes, until tender but pleasantly chewy.

Sweet Potato Pizza Crust (ElaVegan)

Makes: 1 crust (about 8 slices)

INGREDIENTS
- 1 medium sweet potato (enough to make 1 cup mashed sweet potato)
- 3/4 cup white rice flour (plus more if needed)
- 1/3 cup tapioca flour/starch
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Cooking spray or a little oil (for parchment)
- Optional: a tiny splash of water or oil (only if dough is too dry)
- Your favorite pizza toppings (sauce, veggies, cheese/vegan cheese, etc.)

STEPS
1) Cook + mash the sweet potato:
   - Ingredients: 1 medium sweet potato, water
   - Peel and chop sweet potato into chunks. Boil in water about 10 minutes, until fork-tender. Drain well, then mash until smooth.
   - Measure out 1 cup mashed sweet potato for the dough.

2) Heat oven:
   - Preheat oven to 375°F.

3) Mix the dough:
   - Ingredients: 1 cup mashed sweet potato, rice flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, salt
   - In a bowl (or the pot you mashed in), mix mashed sweet potato with rice flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, and salt until a shaggy dough forms.

4) Knead + adjust texture:
   - If dough feels too dry/crumbly: add a tiny splash of water or oil and knead again.
   - If dough feels too sticky: add a little more rice flour.
   - Goal: soft, workable dough that can be rolled without sticking too much.

5) Roll + prebake:
   - Ingredients: cooking spray/oil, parchment paper
   - Spray/grease a sheet of parchment. Put dough on it. Place a second sheet of parchment on top.
   - Roll out to your preferred shape, about 1/4–3/8 inch thick.
   - Remove the top parchment (save it).
   - Transfer dough (on the bottom parchment) to a baking sheet and bake 10 minutes.

6) Flip:
   - Carefully place the saved parchment on top of the hot crust, flip it over, then peel off the hot parchment that’s now on top.

7) Top + bake again:
   - Ingredients: your toppings
   - Add toppings, then bake 10–18 minutes more, until the crust edges are crisp and toppings are done.
   - (Lighter toppings bake faster; heavier/veg-loaded pizzas take longer.)

8) Storage:
   - Fridge: store leftovers 3–4 days.
   - Freezer (make-ahead): prebake crust 10 minutes, cool completely, wrap and freeze up to 3 months. To use: bake about 10 minutes, add toppings, bake 10–18 minutes more.

NOTES / OPTIONS
- Tapioca flour/starch: arrowroot flour/starch should work as a substitute.
- Rice flour swaps mentioned by the author: buckwheat flour or quinoa flour for a grain-free direction; almond flour for a paleo direction (not tested by author).
