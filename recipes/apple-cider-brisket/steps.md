1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Pat {{brisket}} dry with paper towels and season all over with {{kosher_salt}} and {{black_pepper}}.
2. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat {{neutral_oil}}. Sear the {{brisket}}, turning occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a large baking dish or plate.
3. Reduce heat to medium. In the same pot, arrange {{baby_potatoes}} cut side down and cook undisturbed until lightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add {{carrots}} and {{shallots}}, season with more {{kosher_salt}} and {{black_pepper}}, and stir to release the potatoes.
4. Return {{brisket}} and any accumulated juices to the pot. Pour in {{apple_cider}} and {{broth_choice}}, then add {{thyme}}, {{bay_leaves}}, and {{cayenne}}. Season to taste with {{kosher_salt}} and {{black_pepper}}, cover, and bring to a boil.
5. Once boiling, transfer the covered pot to the oven and roast until the brisket is easily shreddable, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
6. Discard {{thyme}} and {{bay_leaves}}. Shred {{brisket}} with two forks. Arrange the meat on a platter with the vegetables and spoon the cooking juices over the top.
