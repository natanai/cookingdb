1. In a pot, melt {{butter}} and briefly sauté {{onion}} until translucent.
2. Stir in {{wheat_flour}} and cook for about 3 minutes to form a roux.
3. Gradually whisk in {{chicken_broth}} and {{milk}}. Bring to a boil while whisking constantly.
4. Lower the heat, then add {{parsley}}, {{watercress}}, {{nutmeg}}, {{salt}}, and {{black_pepper}}. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes, keeping the greens bright.
5. For an extra smooth soup, blend some of the hot liquid with the greens before adding, or purée briefly after cooking. Serve hot; add cooked chicken if desired.
