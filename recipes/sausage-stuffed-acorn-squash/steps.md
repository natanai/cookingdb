1. Heat the oven to 375°F (191°C). Halve {{acorn_squash}} lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Place cut side down in a baking pan with about {{roasting_water}} added to the bottom.
2. Roast for about 35 minutes, until the squash is tender.
3. While the squash roasts, brown {{sausage}} in a skillet. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of drippings.
4. Add {{onion}} and {{celery}} to the skillet and sauté for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in {{bread_crumbs}}.
5. Quickly fold {{sausage}} and {{cheese}} into the breadcrumb mixture.
6. Turn the squash halves cut side up, sprinkle with {{salt}}, and fill the cavities with the sausage mixture.
7. Bake at 350°F (177°C) for 20–30 minutes, until the stuffing is browned and heated through.
