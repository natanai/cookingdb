1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment.
2. In a large bowl, beat {{butter_choice}}, {{white_sugar}}, and {{brown_sugar}} until creamy.
3. Add {{egg_choice}}, {{molasses}}, and {{vanilla_extract}} to the bowl and mix until fully combined.
4. Mix in {{gf_flour}}, {{baking_soda}}, {{baking_powder}}, and {{salt}} until a smooth dough forms.
5. Stir in {{chocolate_chips}}.
6. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) onto the prepared sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
7. Bake for 8–10 minutes, until the edges just start to turn golden and the centers are soft. Cool briefly on the sheet before transferring to a rack.
